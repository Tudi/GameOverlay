Project aims to be a generic virtual reality enhancement tool to augment user capabilities.
In other words it sees what players see and be able to react to it.
Example in a 3d shooter game it can see objects moving and try to move mouse to that location. If mouse reached location ( actually screen changed ) than click with right mouse.
